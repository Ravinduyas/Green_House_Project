# IoT-based Greenhouse Management System

## 
### In a collaborative team project competition, we developed an innovative IoT-based Greenhouse Management System aimed at transforming the way greenhouses operate. Our multidisciplinary team combined expertise in software engineering, electronics, and agriculture to create a solution that helps farmers and greenhouse operators optimize environmental conditions, conserve resources, and improve crop yield.
## Key Features
### Real-time Monitoring:

Sensors: Deployed throughout the greenhouse, sensors measure key parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture.
Data Collection: The collected data is sent to a central server where it is processed and analyzed.
Automated Control Systems:

Climate Control: Automatically adjusts heating, cooling, on real-time sensor data to maintain optimal growing conditions.
Irrigation Management: Uses soil moisture data to automate watering schedules, ensuring plants receive the right amount of water.# Green_House_Project
